# readingProgressRecorder

This application can record your progress on reading a book

# Idea

I got inspired by this twitter thread below on overcoming procrastination:

What resognate with me the most is that "Just the fact that you got up from bed and moved so much as a needle every day is sufficient."

I used to, and still struggle with readig everyday. I once tried to keep reading 50 pages a day and finished reading 2 books one after the other. But I couldn't continue on that. Probably because reading 50 pages a day is somehow too much for me. And when I read this thread, I realized that the amount of pages I read is not what matters, just keep reading everyday matters.
So I though that it would be great if I can build something where I can enter the number of pages I read everyday and will be able to see a progress bar. Also, the most important point made in this thread is to check everyday you did something on a calendar. I would love to have a calendar to check.

# Difficulties

Well this is just an idea now. I don't know how to turn it into a usable application.
The problems I can think of now includes:
1. How will it be presented. Will it be a website? An ios application? Or are there other forms. Because even if I will just be using it myself, I will have to store some information permanently. The only solution I can think of now is to make it a website and host it on my localhost.
2. How to achieve "check the calendar"? This sounds like a hard one. Will have to do some research on that.

# Use cases
1. Users will be able to enter, see, change and delete book information, including name, cover pic, author, description, and most importantly, number of pages. (CRUD)
2. Users will be able to enter the number of pages they finished reading that day.
3. After entering the number of the pages, users will be shown a progress bar and a calendar on which today's date was checked.
